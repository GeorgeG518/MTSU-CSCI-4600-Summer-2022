# Getting Started

1. First, you will need to download Julia Lang from the official website: https://julialang.org/downloads/
2. After you download it, you will have the Julia REPL which is notionally similar to the interactive python interpreter.
    Go ahead and open it up. You will see something like this:

3. If you want Julia Jupyter Notebook Interactivity, enter these commands into the Julia REPL:
    ```console 
    using Pkg
    Pkg.add("IJulia")
    ```

4. You are done. Now when you create a new jupyter notebook, you will have the option of creating a Julia notebook.

### 7/18
Started the Julia notebook. REally enjoy it! I have covered some variable assignment stuff and a whole lot of operator stuff
and math functions. Hopefully next session I will do file I/O, loops, and arrays.
