# A Few Things About the Module
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
My intention with this module is to do some independent math learning. I am familiar with the idea of ODEs and PDEs
but not really too knowledgeable on how they play into programming.
I am not taking numerical analysis, but I feel like it would be a good idea to at least touch on some concepts from it
so I can better understand the codes that are given to me at work.

I also want to touch on interpolation, Fourier transformations, and Taylor series. 

Really this module is going to be just looking around and trying to round out my math knowledge that I didn't get from class.
My vision is that I will have a bunch of jupyter notebooks that are made from me following along with videos or chapters from 
my book. 

I want to create jupyter notebooks that serve as examples of how to code the math concepts, but also serve as a reference for them. 

# Daily Log

## 6/27/2022 
Started math module officially. Created linalgnotebook.ipynb

##6/28
Worked my way through vectors, nearly half way done with matrices. Taking simple ELI5 notes, and also cells showing how to program the operations
I am talking about

# File List

## linalgnotebook.ipynb
Jupyter notebook that contains all of the linear algebra stuff that I think is important.
