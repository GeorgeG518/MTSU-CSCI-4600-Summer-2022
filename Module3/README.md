# A Few Things About the Module
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
My intention with this module is to do some independent math learning. I am familiar with the idea of ODEs and PDEs
but not really too knowledgeable on how they play into programming.
I am not taking numerical analysis, but I feel like it would be a good idea to at least touch on some concepts from it
so I can better understand the codes that are given to me at work.

I also want to touch on interpolation, Fourier transformations, and Taylor series. 

Really this module is going to be just looking around and trying to round out my math knowledge that I didn't get from class.
My vision is that I will have a bunch of jupyter notebooks that are made from me following along with videos or chapters from 
my book.
