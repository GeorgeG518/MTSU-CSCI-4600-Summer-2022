will fill out later

TODO...place into :
1. Describe Environment setup: 
	git bash, IntelOneAPI HPC package, Julia lang, Anaconda3
	Not sure if i need it yet, but I also have WSL3 set up
	Computer is AMD Ryzen 5 w/ 6 cores overclocked to 4.1ghz, 32gb of ram, Nvidia RTX 3060 graphics card

2. Learning Resources:
	Books:
		Numerical Recipes in Fortran 77 / DIGITAL Fortran 90
			won't use fixed form
			Both were gifts and the only fortran reference I have in book form

		Computational Physics by Michael Bestehorn
			Has more fortran code and also an online tar archive of computational physics stuff
			It's a little over my head, but it has some CFD and heat transfer problems with it
				that might be interesting to look at

		Python Programming and Numerical Methods for Engineers and Scientists by Kong, Siayen, Bayen
			Not going to use the python programming tutorial in the first half...
			I WILL use the chapters on numerical methods and c interfacing

		Linear Algebra 2nd Edition by Lipschutz
			I got this book at Goodwill a few years ago before I went to college. Haven't had 
			LA so it will be used as reference for any kind of stuff like that
	Online:
		InteloneAPI stuff:
			Docs for each compiler, library, component: 
				https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/oneapi/components.html#gs.z8ddr9

2. General Rundown of Modules and goals by the end of the summer
	README for each module that states each file, what I learned, how to run, etc
		Point of these is to learn markdown text formatting as that would be pretty useful
