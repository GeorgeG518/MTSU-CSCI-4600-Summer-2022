This will expand as I go, really just a overhead view

# 1. Environment Description:
## Installed Packages:
* git bash
  * Very useful because it gives me git, linux CLI, and linux workflows all on windows
  * I know WSL gives me all of that, but I'd have to doubly install oneAPI and Anaconda...not about that

* IntelOneAPI HPC package
  * A godsend...has C, C++, Fortran compilers using intel technology all in one install.
  * HPC package is required because it allows me to offload to GPU, use MPI, and compile Fortran.
  * Above all...it is FREE!

* Julia lang [if I have time]
  * If I have time by the end of the semester, I want to learn Julia.
  * It appears that it is in a position to find use at the base if more people know about it...
    * Speed of Fortran but the ease of use of Python? Give it to me, please. 
    * Already being used by NASA as a replacement for Matlab and Simulink, so government is indeed adopting it.

* Anaconda3
  * I will not be using the anaconda installed with oneAPI

* WSL Ubuntu
  * Not sure if i need this yet actually 

## System Information
### Processor: AMD Ryzen 5 5600X w/ 6 cores overclocked to 4.1ghz
### RAM: 32gb of ram
### GPU: Nvidia RTX 3060 graphics card
### Other Notes: <p> AMD has their own compilers optimized for their CPUs, but oneAPI is processor agnostic and way more convenient. Therefore, I will not be using them. They're essentially forks of LLVM anyway. Not sure what this will entail.
<p>

	

# 2. Resources:
	
## Books:
	
### Numerical Recipes in Fortran 77 / DIGITAL Fortran 90
* I will not use fixed form [*thank god*]
* The first book is for algorithm type stuff if I get stuck
* Both were gifts and the only fortran reference I have in book form
			
### Computational Physics by Michael Bestehorn
* Has more fortran code and also an online tar archive of computational physics stuff
* It's a little over my head, but it has some CFD, ODE/PDE and heat transfer problems with it that might be interesting to look at

### Python Programming and Numerical Methods for Engineers and Scientists by Kong, Siayen, Bayen
* Not going to use the python programming tutorial in the first half...feel confident that I'm passed that point
* I WILL use the chapters on numerical methods and c interfacing

### Linear Algebra 2nd Edition by Lipschutz
* I got this book at Goodwill a few years ago before I went to college. Haven't had 
* LA so it will be used as reference for any kind of stuff like that

	
## Online:
	
### InteloneAPI stuff:
* Docs for each compiler, library, component: 
* https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/oneapi/components.html#gs.z8ddr9
			
### Markdown Text:
* https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/
		

	
# 3. General Rundown of Modules and goals by the end of the summer *SUBJECT TO MOST EXPANSION*:
	
<p>The point of these are to learn markdown text formatting as that would be pretty useful, but also make writing the report easier. I want it to be a matter of copy and pasting instead of trying to write a full blown paper at the end of the summer.<p>
	
## Every Module Requires the Following in a README:
* Each file's purpose
* What I learned
* how to run
* Short log of when I worked on things
